<span style="background:#ffff00">I have been applying for jobs via Indeed dot Com and am starting to get interview requests. Hopefully within the next two months, I will have a job and, hence, a source of income other than donations from my parents. In the meantime, I am spending most of my time hanging out in Dublin in places which are out of the rain and within walking distance of electrical outlets and free public Wi-Fi. I mostly have been using my AT&T mobile data to tether my Android phone (~$100) to my HP laptop (~400) using a USB-C cable (~$10) at a rate of $20 per every 3 Gigabytes (in addition to $30 per month for basic phone service). I am still borrowing my mom's car and have been keeping it parked in the East Dublin BART station parking garage while trying to drive that car as little as possible to keep the engine running and to hold down a job and to do some occasional odd errands. I am still 99% vegan (but I allow myself to go off vegainism for occasional taste tests).</span>
