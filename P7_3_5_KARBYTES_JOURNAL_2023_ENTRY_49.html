<p><span style="background:#ffff00">I have been applying for jobs via Indeed dot Com and am starting to get interview requests. Hopefully within the next two months, I will have a job and, hence, a source of income other than donations from my parents. In the meantime, I am spending most of my time hanging out in Dublin in places which are out of the rain and within walking distance of electrical outlets and free public Wi-Fi. I mostly have been using my AT&amp;T mobile data to tether my Android phone (~$100) to my HP laptop (~400) using a USB-C cable (~$10) at a rate of $20 per every 3 Gigabytes (in addition to $30 per month for basic phone service). I am still borrowing my mom&#8217;s car and have been keeping it parked in the East Dublin BART station parking garage while trying to drive that car as little as possible to keep the engine running and to hold down a job and to do some occasional odd errands. I am still 99% vegan (but I allow myself to go off veganism for occasional taste tests).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">Today I did a phone interview for a local sandwich shop I applied to work at in Dublin. Tomorrow I have an in-person interview at that place. My intuition suggests I am making progress in the most desirable direction. For those who ask me if and when I&#8217;m going to get a full time job as a software engineer, I say this: computer science and physics are what I want to focus on long term whether I am paid to do so or not. My short term game is getting a full or part time job doing something which I think sounds ideally for university students to do (but I am self taught on a flexible study schedule which means I have minimal employment hour restrictions) and using the money I earn from my job to pay for my basic expenses and to build an emergency fund to cover things like replacing my phone and laptop. I intend to get a bicycle as soon as feasible because I miss going on bike rides. In my free time I intend to keep doing psychonautics, algorithmics, art, and general research. There is an abundance of media to consume, recreational options to pursue, and interesting ideas to contemplate. What there is a scarcity of is time, money, cognitive resources, and physiological functioning capacity. I cannot function minimally well without adequate dietary, exercise, recreation, and sleep habits. Hence, I will not try to compete with relatively tireless and productive robots. As a student of computation and cosmology, I think my biggest contribution to human civilization is Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and other websites which I consider to be part of the karbytes empire. I take pride in what I do and I consider myself to be part of a growing community of science, technology, philosophy, and art geeks. (In order to be minimally content and not just an animal to manage, I need to focus on interesting worldly subject matter and not just personal upkeep. Otherwise, I do not feel that I am making enough satisfying progress as time elapses. Unless I am incarcerated long term or otherwise seriously prevented from doing much more than subsisting on life support in captivity against my will, I intend to have quite ambitious personal goals and quality of life standards).</span></p>
<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff0000">As a female-to-male transsexual, I think that I am treated worse by people than I am as a cisgendered female. Therefore, my preference and fulfillment of that preference is not socially beneficial in most cases. For that reason, many people think I should quit taking testosterone injections and resume identifying as a cisgendered female because that &#8220;invites&#8221; less adversity than what I am currently doing: taking testosterone injections on a cyclical basis to masculinize my physiology. I am probably losing money and shortening my life expectancy as a result of making such a socially unsupported decision. Without a husband&#8217;s protection, I am living in harsh and desolate circumstances. Without children to be the mother of, I am being treated as a freeloader who is not making enough of a personal sacrifice and contribution to society. As a single functionally autistic transman who wants to be as solitary as possible yet able to hold down a job and participate in society in ways which I think are worthwhile, I am getting what I think is the best deal out of how I could use my own life. The advice and feedback I generate is primarily for my own entertainment and performance enhancement and not necessarily relevant to other persons. I do not want to be a parent nor do I want to be married nor do I want to live in the same house as other people. I would clearly rather spend most of my free time outside than at my parents&#8217; houses for that reason: to be alone rather than socially enmeshed in egos I do not want to be infected by nor supportive of. I wish to be 100% economically independent from my family of origin even if that means I stop interacting with them and live as though my family of origin is dead. They have already taken up more of my cognitive resources and time than I wanted to allocate to them.</strong></p>
